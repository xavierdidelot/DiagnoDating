                   discipline using sequence data to co-estimate the
                   timing of evolutionary events and rates of molecular
                   evolution. All molecular-dating methods require
                   converting genetic divergence between sequences into
                   absolute time. Historically, this could only be
                   achieved by associating externally derived dates
                   obtained from fossil or biogeographical evidence to
                   internal nodes of the tree. In some cases, notably
                   for fast-evolving genomes such as viruses and some
                   bacteria, the timespan over which samples were
                   collected may cover a significant proportion of the
                   time since they last shared a common ancestor. This
                   situation allows phylogenetic trees to be calibrated
                   by associating sampling dates directly to the
                   sequences representing the tips (terminal nodes) of
                   the tree. The increasing availability of genomic data
                   from ancient DNA extends the applicability of such
                   tip-based calibration to a variety of taxa including
                   humans, extinct megafauna and various micro-organisms
                   which typically have a scarce fossil record. The

                   datasets (e.g. whole genomes) has allowed using
                   tip-dating methods to reach inferences on divergence
                   times, substitution rates, past demography or the age
                   of specific mutations on a variety of spatio-temporal
                   scales. In this review, we summarize the current
                   state-of-the-art of tip-dating, discuss some recent
                   applications, highlight common pitfalls and provide a

                   major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint
                   modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly
                   appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only
                   be adequately answered by combining evidence from
                   multiple independent sources of data, including
                   genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data,
                   radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and
                   biogeographic range information among others.
                   Including all relevant data into a single joint model
                   is very challenging both conceptually and
                   computationally. Advanced computational software
                   packages that allow robust development of compatible
                   (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model
                   hierarchy have played a key role in these
                   developments. Developing such software frameworks is
                   increasingly a major scientific activity in its own
                   right, and comes with specific challenges, from
                   practical software design, development and
                   engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual
                   modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such
                   computational software platform, and was first
                   announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series
                   of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core
                   platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since
                   the first release of the software, culminating in the

                   evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data
                   sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming
                   increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g.,
                   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral
                   events is one of the first, essential goals with such
                   data.However, current sophisticated probabilistic
                   approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size.
                   Here,we present very fast dating algorithms, based on
                   a Gaussian model closely related to the
                   Langley--Fitchmolecular-clockmodel.We showthat this
                   model is robust to uncorrelated violations of
                   themolecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial
                   data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled
                   through times. They estimate the substitution rate
                   and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input
                   tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for
                   the root position, thus representing a new, practical
                   alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g.,
                   midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree
                   (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the
                   close relationships between least- squares and linear
                   algebra.We distinguish between an unconstrained
                   setting and the case where the temporal precedence
                   constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older
                   that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With
                   rooted trees, the former is solved using linear
                   algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional
                   to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the
                   latter, constrained setting, is based on an
                   active-set method that runs in nearly linear time.
                   With unrooted trees the computing time becomes
                   (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square
                   of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large
                   input trees ({$>$}10,000 taxa) can easily be
                   processed and transformed into time-scaled trees.We
                   compare these algorithms to standardmethods
                   (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley--Fitchmethod,
                   and BEAST). Using simulated data,we showthat their
                   estimation accuracy is similar to that of themost
                   sophisticated methods, while theircomputing time
                   ismuch faster.We apply these algorithms on a large
                   data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus
                   from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results
                   showthat these algorithms provide a very fast
                   alternative with results similar to those of other
                   computer programs. These algorithms are implemented
                   in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can
                   be downloaded from
                   http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all

                   or lineage of interest can lead to key insights into
                   its evolution, ecology or epidemiology. The tool of
                   choice for such a study is often to build a
                   phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when
                   possible a dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all
                   common ancestors are estimated. Here we propose a new
                   Bayesian methodology to construct dated phylogenies
                   which is specifically designed for bacterial
                   genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at
                   building dated phylogenies, we consider that the
                   phylogenetic relationships between the genomes have
                   been previously evaluated using a standard
                   phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology much
                   faster and scalable. This two-steps approach also
                   allows us to directly exploit existing phylogenetic
                   methods that detect bacterial recombination, and
                   therefore to account for the effect of recombination
                   in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We analysed
                   many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the
                   performance of our approach in a wide range of
                   situations. Furthermore, we present applications to
                   three different real datasets from recent bacterial
                   genomic studies. Our methodology is implemented in a
                   R package called BactDating which is freely available

                   detailed spatio-temporal spread. Such phylodynamic
                   analyses are particularly useful to understand the
                   epidemiology of rapidly evolving viral pathogens. The
                   number of genome sequences available for different
                   pathogens, however, has increased dramatically over
                   the last couple of years and traditional methods for
                   phylodynamic analysis scale poorly with growing data
                   sets. Here, we present TreeTime, a python based
                   framework for phylodynamic analysis using an
                   approximate Maximum Likelihood approach. TreeTime can
                   estimate ancestral states, infer evolution models,
                   reroot trees to maximize temporal signals, estimate
                   molecular clock phylogenies and population size
                   histories. The run time of TreeTime scales linearly
                   with data set size. Phylogenetics uses differences
                   between homologous se-quences to infer the history of
                   the sample and learn about the evolutionary processes
                   that gave rise to the observed diversity. In absence
                   of recombination, this history is a tree along which
                   sequences descend from ancestors with modification.
                   In gen-eral, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
                   is a computation-ally difficult problem but efficient
                   heuristics often produce re-liable reconstructions in
                   polynomial time (Felsenstein, 2004; Price et al.,
                   2010; Stamatakis, 2014). Such heuristics become
                   indispensible for large data sets of hundreds or
                   thousands of sequences. In addition to tree building,
                   many research questions re-quire parameter inference
                   and hypothesis testing (Drummond et al., 2012; Pond
                   and Muse, 2005). Again, exact inference and testing
                   with large data sets is computationally expensive
                   since it requires high-dimensional optimization of
                   complex likelihood functions or extensive sampling of
                   the posterior. Efficient heuristics are needed to
                   cope with the growing data sets available today.},

                   and ancient samples allows the reconstruction of
                   important demographic and evolutionary processes. A
                   critical component of these analyses is the
                   estimation of evolutionary rates, which can be
                   calibrated using information about the ages of the
                   samples. However, the reliability of these rate
                   estimates can be negatively affected by among-lineage
                   rate variation and non-random sampling. Using a
                   simulation study, we compared the performance of
                   three phylogenetic methods for inferring evolutionary
                   rates from time-structured data sets: regression of
                   root-to-tip distances, least-squares dating, and
                   Bayesian inference. We also applied these three
                   methods to time-structured mitogenomic data sets from
                   six vertebrate species. Results: Our results from 12
                   simulation scenarios show that the three methods
                   produce reliable estimates when the substitution rate
                   is high, rate variation is low, and samples of
                   similar ages are not all grouped together in the tree
                   (i.e., low phylo-temporal clustering). The
                   interaction of these factors is particularly
                   important for least-squares dating and Bayesian
                   estimation of evolutionary rates. The three
                   estimation methods produced consistent estimates of
                   rates across most of the six mitogenomic data sets,
                   with sequence data from horses being an exception.
                   Conclusions: We recommend that phylogenetic studies
                   of ancient DNA sequences should use multiple methods
                   of inference and test for the presence of temporal
                   signal, among-lineage rate variation, and
                   phylo-temporal clustering in the data.},

                   sequences sampled at different times, to estimate the
                   age of their most recent common ancestor. Several
                   tests of ``temporal signal'' are available to
                   determine whether datasets are suitable for such
                   analysis. However, it remains unclear whether these
                   tests are reliable. We investigate the performance of
                   several tests of temporal signal, including some
                   recently suggested modifications. We use simulated
                   data (where the true evolutionary history is known),
                   and whole-genomes of methicillin-resistant
                   Staphylococcus aureus (to show how particular
                   problems arise with real-world data sets). We show
                   that all of the standard tests of temporal signal are
                   seriously misleading for data where temporal and
                   genetic structure are confounded (i.e. where
                   closely-related sequences are more likely to have
                   been sampled at similar times). This is not an
                   artefact of genetic structure or tree shape per se,
                   and can arise even when sequences have measurably
                   evolved during the sampling period. More positively,
                   we show that a ``clustered permutation'' approach
                   introduced by Duch{\^e}ne et al. (2015a) can
                   successfully correct for this artefact in all cases,
                   and introduce techniques for implementing this method
                   with real data sets. The confounding of temporal and
                   genetic structure may be difficult to avoid in
                   practice, particularly for outbreaks of infectious
                   disease, or when using ancient DNA. Therefore, we
                   recommend the use of ``clustered permutation'' for
                   all analyses. The failure of the standard tests may
                   explain why different methods of dating pathogen
                   origins have reached such wildly different
                   conclusions. This article is protected by copyright.

                   for model selection in the field of Bayesian
                   phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized
                   the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator
                   (HME). Although these studies have shown the merits
                   of new approaches applied to standard normally
                   distributed examples and small real-world data sets,
                   not much is currently known concerning the
                   performance and computational issues of these methods
                   when fitting complex evolutionary and population
                   genetic models to empirical real-world data sets.
                   Further, these approaches have not yet seen
                   widespread application in the field due to the lack
                   of implementations of these computationally demanding
                   techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We
                   here investigate the performance of some of these new
                   marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path
                   sampling (PS) and stepping-stone (SS) sampling for
                   comparing models of demographic change and relaxed
                   molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world
                   examples for which unexpected inferences were made
                   using the HME. Given the drastically increased
                   computational demands of PS and SS sampling, we also
                   investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of
                   Akaike's information criterion (AIC) through Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a model comparison approach
                   that shares with the HME the appealing feature of
                   having a low computational overhead over the original
                   MCMC analysis. We confirm that the HME systematically
                   overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to
                   yield reliable model classification and show that the
                   AICM performs better and may be a useful initial
                   evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a
                   lesser degree, unreliable. We show that PS and SS
                   sampling substantially outperform these estimators
                   and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous
                   analyses for the three real-world data sets that we
                   reanalyzed. The methods used in this article are now

                   our method can accurately recover the true underlying

                   Bayesian methods has many benefits, which include
                   providing a mathematically sound framework, providing
                   realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to
                   incorporate different sources of information based on
                   formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are
                   popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data,
                   however for such studies one needs to specify a site
                   model and associated substitution model. Often, the
                   parameters of the site model is of no interest and an
                   ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is
                   used to select a single site model. Results:
                   bModelTest allows for a Bayesian approach to
                   inferring and marginalizing site models in a
                   phylogenetic analysis. It is based on
                   trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                   proposals that allow switching between substitution
                   models as well as estimating the posterior
                   probability for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity,
                   a proportion of invariable sites and unequal base
                   frequencies. The model can be used with the full set
                   of time-reversible models on nucleotides, but we also
                   introduce and demonstrate the use of two subsets of
                   time-reversible substitution models. Conclusion: With
                   the new method the site model can be inferred (and
                   marginalized) during the MCMC analysis and does not
                   need to be pre-determined, as is now often the case
                   in practice, by likelihood-based methods. The method
                   is implemented in the bModelTest package of the

                   of viral evolution can be estimated using
                   phylogenetic analyses of time-structured molecular
                   sequences. This involves the use of molecular-clock
                   methods, calibrated by the sampling times of the
                   viral sequences. However, the spread of these
                   sampling times is not always sufficient to allow the
                   substitution rate to be estimated accurately. We
                   conducted Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of simulated
                   virus data to evaluate the performance of the
                   date-randomization test, which is sometimes used to
                   investigate whether time-structured data sets have
                   temporal signal. An estimate of the substitution rate
                   passes this test if its mean does not fall within the
                   95\% credible intervals of rate estimates obtained
                   using replicate data sets in which the sampling
                   stimes have been randomized. We find that the test
                   sometimes fails to detect rate estimates from data
                   with no temporal signal. This error can be minimized
                   by using a more conservative criterion, whereby the
                   95\% credible interval of the estimate with correct
                   sampling times should not overlap with those obtained
                   with randomized sampling times. We also investigated
                   the behavior of the test when the sampling times are
                   not uniformly distributed throughout the tree, which
                   sometimes occurs in empirical data sets. The test
                   performs poorly in these circumstances, such that a
                   modification to the randomization scheme is needed.
                   Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the test in
                   analyses of nucleotide sequences of cereal yellow
                   dwarf virus. Our results validate the use of the

  abstract =      {Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of
                   molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular
                   clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates
                   and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and
                   data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key
                   aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient
                   amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the
                   sampling time window, that is, whether the data can
                   be treated as having come from a measurably evolving
                   population. Here, we investigate the performance of a
                   fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS)
                   in sequence data. The method involves comparing the
                   fit to the data of two models: a model in which the
                   data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous)
                   sampling times, and a model in which the samples are
                   constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We
                   conducted simulations under a wide range of
                   conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately
                   classifies data sets according to whether they
                   contain temporal signal or not, even when there is
                   substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore
                   the behavior of this classification in analyses of
                   five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1
                   influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis,
                   coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from
                   Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog
                   species. Our results indicate that BETS is an
                   effective alternative to other tests of temporal
                   signal. In particular, this method has the key
                   advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the
                   entire model, including the molecular clock and tree
                   prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian
                   phylodynamic analyses.},
