                   discipline using sequence data to co-estimate the
                   timing of evolutionary events and rates of molecular
                   evolution. All molecular-dating methods require
                   converting genetic divergence between sequences into
                   absolute time. Historically, this could only be
                   achieved by associating externally derived dates
                   obtained from fossil or biogeographical evidence to
                   internal nodes of the tree. In some cases, notably
                   for fast-evolving genomes such as viruses and some
                   bacteria, the timespan over which samples were
                   collected may cover a significant proportion of the
                   time since they last shared a common ancestor. This
                   situation allows phylogenetic trees to be calibrated
                   by associating sampling dates directly to the
                   sequences representing the tips (terminal nodes) of
                   the tree. The increasing availability of genomic data
                   from ancient DNA extends the applicability of such
                   tip-based calibration to a variety of taxa including
                   humans, extinct megafauna and various micro-organisms
                   which typically have a scarce fossil record. The

                   datasets (e.g. whole genomes) has allowed using
                   tip-dating methods to reach inferences on divergence
                   times, substitution rates, past demography or the age
                   of specific mutations on a variety of spatio-temporal
                   scales. In this review, we summarize the current
                   state-of-the-art of tip-dating, discuss some recent
                   applications, highlight common pitfalls and provide a

                   major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint
                   modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly
                   appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only
                   be adequately answered by combining evidence from
                   multiple independent sources of data, including
                   genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data,
                   radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and
                   biogeographic range information among others.
                   Including all relevant data into a single joint model
                   is very challenging both conceptually and
                   computationally. Advanced computational software
                   packages that allow robust development of compatible
                   (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model
                   hierarchy have played a key role in these
                   developments. Developing such software frameworks is
                   increasingly a major scientific activity in its own
                   right, and comes with specific challenges, from
                   practical software design, development and
                   engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual
                   modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such
                   computational software platform, and was first
                   announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series
                   of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core
                   platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since
                   the first release of the software, culminating in the

                   evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data
                   sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming
                   increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g.,
                   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral
                   events is one of the first, essential goals with such
                   data.However, current sophisticated probabilistic
                   approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size.
                   Here,we present very fast dating algorithms, based on
                   a Gaussian model closely related to the
                   Langley--Fitchmolecular-clockmodel.We showthat this
                   model is robust to uncorrelated violations of
                   themolecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial
                   data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled
                   through times. They estimate the substitution rate
                   and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input
                   tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for
                   the root position, thus representing a new, practical
                   alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g.,
                   midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree
                   (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the
                   close relationships between least- squares and linear
                   algebra.We distinguish between an unconstrained
                   setting and the case where the temporal precedence
                   constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older
                   that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With
                   rooted trees, the former is solved using linear
                   algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional
                   to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the
                   latter, constrained setting, is based on an
                   active-set method that runs in nearly linear time.
                   With unrooted trees the computing time becomes
                   (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square
                   of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large
                   input trees ({$>$}10,000 taxa) can easily be
                   processed and transformed into time-scaled trees.We
                   compare these algorithms to standardmethods
                   (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley--Fitchmethod,
                   and BEAST). Using simulated data,we showthat their
                   estimation accuracy is similar to that of themost
                   sophisticated methods, while theircomputing time
                   ismuch faster.We apply these algorithms on a large
                   data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus
                   from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results
                   showthat these algorithms provide a very fast
                   alternative with results similar to those of other
                   computer programs. These algorithms are implemented
                   in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can
                   be downloaded from
                   http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all

                   or lineage of interest can lead to key insights into
                   its evolution, ecology or epidemiology. The tool of
                   choice for such a study is often to build a
                   phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when
                   possible a dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all
                   common ancestors are estimated. Here we propose a new
                   Bayesian methodology to construct dated phylogenies
                   which is specifically designed for bacterial
                   genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at
                   building dated phylogenies, we consider that the
                   phylogenetic relationships between the genomes have
                   been previously evaluated using a standard
                   phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology much
                   faster and scalable. This two-steps approach also
                   allows us to directly exploit existing phylogenetic
                   methods that detect bacterial recombination, and
                   therefore to account for the effect of recombination
                   in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We analysed
                   many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the
                   performance of our approach in a wide range of
                   situations. Furthermore, we present applications to
                   three different real datasets from recent bacterial
                   genomic studies. Our methodology is implemented in a
                   R package called BactDating which is freely available

                   detailed spatio-temporal spread. Such phylodynamic
                   analyses are particularly useful to understand the
                   epidemiology of rapidly evolving viral pathogens. The
                   number of genome sequences available for different
                   pathogens, however, has increased dramatically over
                   the last couple of years and traditional methods for
                   phylodynamic analysis scale poorly with growing data
                   sets. Here, we present TreeTime, a python based
                   framework for phylodynamic analysis using an
                   approximate Maximum Likelihood approach. TreeTime can
                   estimate ancestral states, infer evolution models,
                   reroot trees to maximize temporal signals, estimate
                   molecular clock phylogenies and population size
                   histories. The run time of TreeTime scales linearly
                   with data set size. Phylogenetics uses differences
                   between homologous se-quences to infer the history of
                   the sample and learn about the evolutionary processes
                   that gave rise to the observed diversity. In absence
                   of recombination, this history is a tree along which
                   sequences descend from ancestors with modification.
                   In gen-eral, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
                   is a computation-ally difficult problem but efficient
                   heuristics often produce re-liable reconstructions in
                   polynomial time (Felsenstein, 2004; Price et al.,
                   2010; Stamatakis, 2014). Such heuristics become
                   indispensible for large data sets of hundreds or
                   thousands of sequences. In addition to tree building,
                   many research questions re-quire parameter inference
                   and hypothesis testing (Drummond et al., 2012; Pond
                   and Muse, 2005). Again, exact inference and testing
                   with large data sets is computationally expensive
                   since it requires high-dimensional optimization of
                   complex likelihood functions or extensive sampling of
                   the posterior. Efficient heuristics are needed to
                   cope with the growing data sets available today.},

  abstract =      {Recent years have seen a remarkable increase in the
                   practicality of sequencing whole genomes from large
                   numbers of bacterial isolates. The availability of
                   this data has huge potential to deliver new insights
                   into the evolution and epidemiology of bacterial
                   pathogens, but the scalability of the analytical
                   methodology has been lagging behind that of the
                   sequencing technology. Here we present a step-by-step
                   approach for such large-scale genomic epidemiology
                   analyses, from bacterial genomes to epidemiological
                   interpretations. A central component of this approach
                   is the dated phylogeny, which is a phylogenetic tree
                   with branch lengths measured in units of time. The
                   construction of dated phylogenies from bacterial
                   genomic data needs to account for the disruptive
                   effect of recombination on phylogenetic
                   relationships, and we describe how this can be
                   achieved. Dated phylogenies can then be used to
                   perform fine-scale or large-scale epidemiological
                   analyses, depending on the proportion of cases for
                   which genomes are available. A key feature of this
                   approach is computational scalability, and in
                   particular the ability to process hundreds or
                   thousands of genomes within a matter of hours. This
                   is a clear advantage of the step-by-step approach
                   described here. We discuss other advantages and
                   disadvantages of the approach, as well as potential
                   improvements and avenues for future
                   research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have

                   statistical framework to extract evolutionary and
                   epidemiological information from pathogen genomes. By
                   harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to
                   shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread
                   and to test hypotheses about the underlying
                   interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics
                   in pathogen populations. Although the field has
                   witnessed a rich development of statistical inference
                   tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these
                   tools initially focused on sequences as their sole
                   primary data source. Integrating various sources of
                   information, however, promises to deliver more
                   precise insights in infectious diseases and to
                   increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis
                   testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of
                   data integration is stimulating new advances in
                   Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which
                   formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and
                   evolutionary biology. These approaches include
                   connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for
                   host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information,
                   but also the incorporation of covariates of
                   evolutionary and epidemic processes in the
                   reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full
                   Bayesian approach to covariate modelling and testing
                   can generate further insights into sequence
                   evolution, trait evolution and population dynamics in
                   pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate
                   how such approaches can be used to test the impact of
                   host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to
                   identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well
                   as the determinants of rabies cross-species
                   transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary
                   dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we
                   briefly discuss how data integration is now also
                   permeating through the inference of transmission
                   dynamics, leading to novel insights into
                   tree-generative processes and detailed
                   reconstructions of transmission trees.},

  abstract =      {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the
                   geographical distribution of viruses has been
                   frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic
                   histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical
                   dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly
                   been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches
                   that provide little insight into the temporal setting
                   of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of
                   probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers
                   unique opportunities to engage in this statistical
                   endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for
                   inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of
                   phylogeographic history. By implementing character
                   mapping in a Bayesian software that samples
                   time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction
                   of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating
                   phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model
                   inference is extended with a stochastic search
                   variable selection procedure that identifies the
                   parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process.
                   In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate
                   geographical sampling distributions or characterize
                   alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To
                   visualize the spatial and temporal information, we
                   summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We
                   describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with
                   previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of
                   the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological
                   linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies
                   in West African dog populations reveals how virus
                   diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through
                   continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we
                   conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make
                   an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can
                   be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from
                   genetic data for many organisms.},

                   infectious disease epidemiology. Isolates from a
                   given outbreak are sequenced, and the patterns of
                   shared variation are used to infer which isolates
                   within the outbreak are most closely related to each
                   other. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees
                   typically used to represent this variation are not
                   directly informative about who infected whom -- a
                   phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree.
                   However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a
                   phylogeny while accounting for within-host genetic
                   diversity by colouring the branches of a phylogeny
                   according to which host those branches were in. Here
                   we extend this approach and show that it can be
                   applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks.
                   This requires computing the correct probability of an
                   observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate
                   how to do this for a large class of epidemiological
                   models. We also demonstrate how the branch colouring
                   approach can incorporate a variable number of unique
                   colours to represent unsampled intermediates in
                   transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is a
                   reversible jump Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, which we
                   apply to both simulated data and real data from an
                   outbreak of tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled
                   cases and an outbreak which may not have reached its
                   end, our method is uniquely suited to use in a public
                   health environment during real-time outbreak
                   investigations. We implemented our technique in an R
                   package called TransPhylo, which is freely available

                   of viral evolution can be estimated using
                   phylogenetic analyses of time-structured molecular
                   sequences. This involves the use of molecular-clock
                   methods, calibrated by the sampling times of the
                   viral sequences. However, the spread of these
                   sampling times is not always sufficient to allow the
                   substitution rate to be estimated accurately. We
                   conducted Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of simulated
                   virus data to evaluate the performance of the
                   date-randomization test, which is sometimes used to
                   investigate whether time-structured data sets have
                   temporal signal. An estimate of the substitution rate
                   passes this test if its mean does not fall within the
                   95\% credible intervals of rate estimates obtained
                   using replicate data sets in which the sampling
                   stimes have been randomized. We find that the test
                   sometimes fails to detect rate estimates from data
                   with no temporal signal. This error can be minimized
                   by using a more conservative criterion, whereby the
                   95\% credible interval of the estimate with correct
                   sampling times should not overlap with those obtained
                   with randomized sampling times. We also investigated
                   the behavior of the test when the sampling times are
                   not uniformly distributed throughout the tree, which
                   sometimes occurs in empirical data sets. The test
                   performs poorly in these circumstances, such that a
                   modification to the randomization scheme is needed.
                   Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the test in
                   analyses of nucleotide sequences of cereal yellow
                   dwarf virus. Our results validate the use of the
                   date-randomization test and allow us to propose
                   guidelines for interpretation of its results.},

  abstract =      {``Dated-tip'' methods of molecular dating use DNA
                   sequences sampled at different times, to estimate the
                   age of their most recent common ancestor. Several
                   tests of ``temporal signal'' are available to
                   determine whether datasets are suitable for such
                   analysis. However, it remains unclear whether these
                   tests are reliable. We investigate the performance of
                   several tests of temporal signal, including some
                   recently suggested modifications. We use simulated
                   data (where the true evolutionary history is known),
                   and whole-genomes of methicillin-resistant
                   Staphylococcus aureus (to show how particular
                   problems arise with real-world data sets). We show
                   that all of the standard tests of temporal signal are
                   seriously misleading for data where temporal and
                   genetic structure are confounded (i.e. where
                   closely-related sequences are more likely to have
                   been sampled at similar times). This is not an
                   artefact of genetic structure or tree shape per se,
                   and can arise even when sequences have measurably
                   evolved during the sampling period. More positively,
                   we show that a ``clustered permutation'' approach
                   introduced by Duch{\^e}ne et al. (2015a) can
                   successfully correct for this artefact in all cases,
                   and introduce techniques for implementing this method
                   with real data sets. The confounding of temporal and
                   genetic structure may be difficult to avoid in
                   practice, particularly for outbreaks of infectious
                   disease, or when using ancient DNA. Therefore, we
                   recommend the use of ``clustered permutation'' for
                   all analyses. The failure of the standard tests may
                   explain why different methods of dating pathogen
                   origins have reached such wildly different
                   conclusions. This article is protected by copyright.

                   has become routine in biology, forming the basis of a
                   wide range of evolutionary and ecological studies.
                   However, there are various sources of bias that can
                   affect these estimates. We investigated whether tree
                   imbalance, a property that is commonly observed in
                   phylogenetic trees, can lead to reduced accuracy or
                   precision of phylogenetic timescale estimates. We
                   analysed simulated data sets with calibrations at
                   internal nodes and at the tips, taking into
                   consideration different calibration schemes and
                   levels of tree imbalance. We also investigated the
                   effect of tree imbalance on two empirical data sets:
                   mitogenomes from primates and serial samples of the
                   African swine fever virus. In analyses calibrated
                   using dated, heterochronous tips, we found that tree
                   imbalance had a detrimental impact on precision and
                   produced a bias in which the overall timescale was
                   underestimated. A pronounced effect was observed in
                   analyses with shallow calibrations. The greatest
                   decreases in accuracy usually occurred in the age
                   estimates for medium and deep nodes of the tree. In
                   contrast, analyses calibrated at internal nodes did
                   not display a reduction in estimation accuracy or
                   precision due to tree imbalance. Our results suggest
                   that molecular-clock analyses can be improved by
                   increasing taxon sampling, with the specific aims of
                   including deeper calibrations, breaking up long
                   branches and reducing tree imbalance.},

  abstract =      {Background: Phylogenetic analysis of DNA from modern
                   and ancient samples allows the reconstruction of
                   important demographic and evolutionary processes. A
                   critical component of these analyses is the
                   estimation of evolutionary rates, which can be
                   calibrated using information about the ages of the
                   samples. However, the reliability of these rate
                   estimates can be negatively affected by among-lineage
                   rate variation and non-random sampling. Using a
                   simulation study, we compared the performance of
                   three phylogenetic methods for inferring evolutionary
                   rates from time-structured data sets: regression of
                   root-to-tip distances, least-squares dating, and
                   Bayesian inference. We also applied these three
                   methods to time-structured mitogenomic data sets from
                   six vertebrate species. Results: Our results from 12
                   simulation scenarios show that the three methods
                   produce reliable estimates when the substitution rate
                   is high, rate variation is low, and samples of
                   similar ages are not all grouped together in the tree
                   (i.e., low phylo-temporal clustering). The
                   interaction of these factors is particularly
                   important for least-squares dating and Bayesian
                   estimation of evolutionary rates. The three
                   estimation methods produced consistent estimates of
                   rates across most of the six mitogenomic data sets,
                   with sequence data from horses being an exception.
                   Conclusions: We recommend that phylogenetic studies
                   of ancient DNA sequences should use multiple methods
                   of inference and test for the presence of temporal
                   signal, among-lineage rate variation, and
                   phylo-temporal clustering in the data.},

                   evolutionary divergence events. The development of
                   relaxed molecular clocks, which model variable
                   substitution rates among lineages, was intended to
                   rectify this problem. Major subtypes of pandemic

                   related lineages with different substitution rates.
                   Here, we report that inferring the time of most

                   phylogeography and biogeography. Perhaps more
                   exciting are recent developments in coalescence-based
                   Bayesian inference that offer the potential to use
                   temporal information from aDNA and mDNA for the
                   estimation of substitution rates and divergence dates
                   as an alternative to fossil and geological
                   calibration. This comes at a time of growing interest
                   in the possibility of time dependency for molecular

                   susceptible to an upward bias in the estimation of
                   substitution rates because of model misspecification
                   when the data come from populations with less than
                   simple demographic histories, including sudden
                   short-lived population bottlenecks or pronounced
                   population structure. However, when model
                   misspecification is only mild, then the 95\% highest
                   posterior density intervals provide adequate
                   frequentist coverage of the true rates.},

                   for model selection in the field of Bayesian
                   phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized
                   the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator
                   (HME). Although these studies have shown the merits
                   of new approaches applied to standard normally
                   distributed examples and small real-world data sets,
                   not much is currently known concerning the
                   performance and computational issues of these methods
                   when fitting complex evolutionary and population
                   genetic models to empirical real-world data sets.
                   Further, these approaches have not yet seen
                   widespread application in the field due to the lack
                   of implementations of these computationally demanding
                   techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We
                   here investigate the performance of some of these new
                   marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path
                   sampling (PS) and stepping-stone (SS) sampling for
                   comparing models of demographic change and relaxed
                   molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world
                   examples for which unexpected inferences were made
                   using the HME. Given the drastically increased
                   computational demands of PS and SS sampling, we also
                   investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of
                   Akaike's information criterion (AIC) through Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a model comparison approach
                   that shares with the HME the appealing feature of
                   having a low computational overhead over the original
                   MCMC analysis. We confirm that the HME systematically
                   overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to
                   yield reliable model classification and show that the
                   AICM performs better and may be a useful initial
                   evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a
                   lesser degree, unreliable. We show that PS and SS
                   sampling substantially outperform these estimators
                   and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous
                   analyses for the three real-world data sets that we
                   reanalyzed. The methods used in this article are now

                   our method can accurately recover the true underlying

                   providing a mathematically sound framework, providing
                   realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to
                   incorporate different sources of information based on
                   formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are
                   popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data,
                   however for such studies one needs to specify a site
                   model and associated substitution model. Often, the
                   parameters of the site model is of no interest and an
                   ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is
                   used to select a single site model. Results:
                   bModelTest allows for a Bayesian approach to
                   inferring and marginalizing site models in a
                   phylogenetic analysis. It is based on
                   trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                   proposals that allow switching between substitution
                   models as well as estimating the posterior
                   probability for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity,
                   a proportion of invariable sites and unequal base
                   frequencies. The model can be used with the full set
                   of time-reversible models on nucleotides, but we also
                   introduce and demonstrate the use of two subsets of
                   time-reversible substitution models. Conclusion: With
                   the new method the site model can be inferred (and
                   marginalized) during the MCMC analysis and does not
                   need to be pre-determined, as is now often the case
                   in practice, by likelihood-based methods. The method

  abstract =      {Phylogenetic methods can use the sampling times of
                   molecular sequence data to calibrate the molecular
                   clock, enabling the estimation of evolutionary rates
                   and timescales for rapidly evolving pathogens and
                   data sets containing ancient DNA samples. A key
                   aspect of such calibrations is whether a sufficient
                   amount of molecular evolution has occurred over the
                   sampling time window, that is, whether the data can
                   be treated as having come from a measurably evolving
                   population. Here, we investigate the performance of a
                   fully Bayesian evaluation of temporal signal (BETS)
                   in sequence data. The method involves comparing the
                   fit to the data of two models: a model in which the
                   data are accompanied by the actual (heterochronous)
                   sampling times, and a model in which the samples are
                   constrained to be contemporaneous (isochronous). We
                   conducted simulations under a wide range of
                   conditions to demonstrate that BETS accurately
                   classifies data sets according to whether they
                   contain temporal signal or not, even when there is
                   substantial among-lineage rate variation. We explore
                   the behavior of this classification in analyses of
                   five empirical data sets: modern samples of A/H1N1
                   influenza virus, the bacterium Bordetella pertussis,
                   coronaviruses from mammalian hosts, ancient DNA from
                   Hepatitis B virus, and mitochondrial genomes of dog
                   species. Our results indicate that BETS is an
                   effective alternative to other tests of temporal
                   signal. In particular, this method has the key
                   advantage of allowing a coherent assessment of the
                   entire model, including the molecular clock and tree
                   prior which are essential aspects of Bayesian
                   phylodynamic analyses.},

  abstract =      {A cardinal challenge in epidemiological and
                   ecological modelling is to develop effective and
                   easily deployed tools for model assessment. The
                   availability of such methods would greatly improve
                   understanding, prediction and management of disease
                   and ecosystems. Conventional Bayesian model
                   assessment tools such as Bayes factors and the
                   deviance information criterion (DIC) are natural
                   candidates but suffer from important limitations
                   because of their sensitivity and complexity.
                   Posterior predictive checks, which use summary
                   statistics of the observed process simulated from
                   competing models, can provide a measure of model fit
                   but appropriate statistics can be difficult to
                   identify. Here, we develop a novel approach for
                   diagnosing mis-specifications of a general
                   spatio-temporal transmission model by embedding
                   classical ideas within a Bayesian analysis.
                   Specifically, by proposing suitably designed
                   non-centred parametrization schemes, we construct
                   latent residuals whose sampling properties are known
                   given the model specification and which can be used
                   to measure overall fit and to elicit evidence of the
                   nature of misspecifications of spatial and temporal
                   processes included in the model. This model
                   assessment approach can readily be implemented as an
                   addendum to standard estimation algorithms for
                   sampling from the posterior distributions, for
                   example Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed
                   methodology is first tested using simulated data and
                   subsequently applied to data describing the spread of
                   Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) across Great
                   Britain over a 30-year period. The proposed methods
                   are compared with alternative techniques including
                   posterior predictive checking and the DIC. Results
                   show that the proposed diagnostic tools are effective
                   in assessing competing stochastic spatio-temporal
                   transmission models and may offer improvements in
                   power to detect model mis-specifications. Moreover,
                   the latent-residual framework introduced here extends
                   readily to a broad range of ecological and
                   epidemiological models. {\copyright} 2014 The

                   of fit and for providing insight into model
                   improvement. However, literature on residual analysis
                   and the goodness of fit for hidden Markov models
                   (HMMs) is limited. As HMMs with complex structures
                   are increasingly used to accommodate different types
                   of data, there is a need for further tools to check
                   the validity of models applied to real world data. We
                   review model checking methods for HMMs and develop
                   new methods motivated by a particular case study
                   involving a two-dimensional HMM developed for time
                   series with many null events. We propose new residual
                   analysis and stochastic reconstruction methods, which
                   are adapted from model checking techniques for point
                   process models. We apply the new methods to the case

                   there is not one ``best'' test for diagnostics but
                   that our new methods have some advantages over
                   previously developed tools. The importance of
                   multiple tests for complex HMMs is highlighted and we
                   use the results of our model checking to provide
                   suggestions for possible improvements to the case

                   used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor
                   interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree
                   topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S.,

                   likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been
                   widely used ({$>$}2500 citations in ISI Web of
                   Science) because of its simplicity and a fair
                   compromise between accuracy and speed. In the
                   meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and
                   this article describes the new algorithms and methods
                   implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new
                   algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined
                   intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting
                   topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used
                   here to filter out the least promising topology
                   modifications with respect to the likelihood
                   function. The analysis of a large collection of real
                   nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes
                   demonstrates the good performance of this method.
                   Second, we describe a new test to assess the support
                   of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny.
                   This approach extends the recently proposed
                   approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a
                   nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A
                   detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on
                   the links between this new approach and the more
                   classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall,
                   our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML

  abstract =      {Phylogenetic dating is one of the most powerful and
                   commonly used methods of drawing epidemiological
                   interpretations from pathogen genomic data. Building
                   such trees requires considering a molecular clock
                   model which represents the rate at which
                   substitutions accumulate on genomes. When the
                   molecular clock rate is constant throughout the tree
                   then the clock is said to be strict, but this is
                   often not an acceptable assumption. Alternatively,
                   relaxed clock models consider variations in the clock
                   rate, often based on a distribution of rates for each
                   branch. However, we show here that the distributions
                   of rates across branches in commonly used relaxed
                   clock models are incompatible with the biological
                   expectation that the sum of the numbers of
                   substitutions on two neighbouring branches should be
                   distributed as the substitution number on a single
                   branch of equivalent length. We call this expectation
                   the additivity property. We further show how
                   assumptions of commonly used relaxed clock models can
                   lead to estimates of evolutionary rates and dates
                   with low precision and biased confidence intervals.
                   We therefore propose a new additive relaxed clock
                   model where the additivity property is satisfied. We
                   illustrate the use of our new additive relaxed clock
                   model on a range of simulated and real datasets, and
                   we show that using this new model leads to more
                   accurate estimates of mean evolutionary rates and
                   ancestral dates.},

  abstract =      {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and
                   the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of
                   a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic
                   inference, it is evident that both are biologically
                   unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process
                   lies between these two extremes. Fortunately,
                   intermediate models employing relaxed molecular
                   clocks have been described. These models open the
                   gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here
                   we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed
                   phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used
                   to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the
                   face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and
                   calibration times. Our approach also provides a means
                   for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and
                   comparing this measure between different genes and
                   phylogenies. We find no significant rate
                   autocorrelation among branches in three large
                   datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are
                   not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition,
                   we place these datasets on the continuum of
                   clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and
                   the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present
                   analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99
                   metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we
                   conclude that our method is phylogenetically more
                   accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted
                   model while adding the ability to infer a timescale
                   to evolution.},

  abstract =      {Background: Bayesian phylogenetic analysis generates
                   a set of trees which are often condensed into a
                   single tree representing the whole set. Many methods
                   exist for selecting a representative topology for a
                   set of unrooted trees, few exist for assigning branch
                   lengths to a fixed topology, and even fewer for
                   simultaneously setting the topology and branch
                   lengths. However, there is very little research into
                   locating a good representative for a set of rooted
                   time trees like the ones obtained from a BEAST
                   analysis. Results: We empirically compare new and
                   known methods for generating a summary tree. Some new
                   methods are motivated by mathematical constructions
                   such as tree metrics, while the rest employ tree
                   concepts which work well in practice. These use more
                   of the posterior than existing methods, which discard
                   information not directly mapped to the chosen
                   topology. Using results from a large number of
                   simulations we assess the quality of a summary tree,
                   measuring (a) how well it explains the sequence data
                   under the model and (b) how close it is to the
                   ``truth'', i.e to the tree used to generate the
                   sequences. Conclusions: Our simulations indicate that
                   no single method is ``best''. Methods producing good
                   divergence time estimates have poor branch lengths
                   and lower model fit, and vice versa. Using the
                   results presented here, a user can choose the
                   appropriate method based on the purpose of the
                   summary tree.},

                   locally acquired cases has important consequences for
                   the selection of public health control strategies.
                   Genomic data can be useful for this, for example
                   using a phylogeographic analysis in which genomic
                   data from multiple locations is compared to determine
                   likely migration events between locations. However,
                   these methods typically require good samples of
                   genomes from all locations, which is rarely
                   available. Here we propose an alternative approach
                   that only uses genomic data from a location of
                   interest. By comparing each new case with previous
                   cases from the same location we are able to detect
                   imported cases, as they have a different genealogical
                   distribution than that of locally acquired cases. We
                   show that, when variations in the size of the local
                   population are accounted for, our method has good
                   sensitivity and excellent specificity for the
                   detection of imports. We applied our method to data
                   simulated under the structured coalescent model and
                   demonstrate relatively good performance even when the
                   local population has the same size as the external
                   population. Finally, we applied our method to several
                   recent genomic datasets from both bacterial and viral
                   pathogens, and show that it can, in a matter of
                   seconds or minutes, deliver important insights on the
                   number of imports to a geographically limited sample

                   histories or large ensembles of such histories.
                   Importantly, phylogenetic trees or networks can be
                   generated alongside the histories they correspond to,
                   enabling investigations into the interplay between
