                   methods has continued at pace in recent years with
                   major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint
                   modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly
                   appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only
                   be adequately answered by combining evidence from
                   multiple independent sources of data, including
                   genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data,
                   radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and
                   biogeographic range information among others.
                   Including all relevant data into a single joint model
                   is very challenging both conceptually and
                   computationally. Advanced computational software
                   packages that allow robust development of compatible
                   (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model
                   hierarchy have played a key role in these
                   developments. Developing such software frameworks is
                   increasingly a major scientific activity in its own
                   right, and comes with specific challenges, from
                   practical software design, development and
                   engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual
                   modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such
                   computational software platform, and was first
                   announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series
                   of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core
                   platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since
                   the first release of the software, culminating in the
                   recent 2.5 release.},

  abstract =      {Phylogenies provide a usefulway to understand the
                   evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data
                   sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming
                   increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g.,
                   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral
                   events is one of the first, essential goals with such
                   data.However, current sophisticated probabilistic
                   approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size.
                   Here,we present very fast dating algorithms, based on
                   a Gaussian model closely related to the
                   Langley--Fitchmolecular-clockmodel.We showthat this
                   model is robust to uncorrelated violations of
                   themolecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial
                   data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled
                   through times. They estimate the substitution rate
                   and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input
                   tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for
                   the root position, thus representing a new, practical
                   alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g.,
                   midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree
                   (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the
                   close relationships between least- squares and linear
                   algebra.We distinguish between an unconstrained
                   setting and the case where the temporal precedence
                   constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older
                   that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With
                   rooted trees, the former is solved using linear
                   algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional
                   to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the
                   latter, constrained setting, is based on an
                   active-set method that runs in nearly linear time.
                   With unrooted trees the computing time becomes
                   (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square
                   of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large
                   input trees ({$>$}10,000 taxa) can easily be
                   processed and transformed into time-scaled trees.We
                   compare these algorithms to standardmethods
                   (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley--Fitchmethod,
                   and BEAST). Using simulated data,we showthat their
                   estimation accuracy is similar to that of themost
                   sophisticated methods, while theircomputing time
                   ismuch faster.We apply these algorithms on a large
                   data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus
                   from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results
                   showthat these algorithms provide a very fast
                   alternative with results similar to those of other
                   computer programs. These algorithms are implemented
                   in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can
                   be downloaded from
                   http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all

                   collection of bacterial genomes from a single species
                   or lineage of interest can lead to key insights into
                   its evolution, ecology or epidemiology. The tool of
                   choice for such a study is often to build a
                   phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when
                   possible a dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all
                   common ancestors are estimated. Here we propose a new
                   Bayesian methodology to construct dated phylogenies
                   which is specifically designed for bacterial
                   genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at
                   building dated phylogenies, we consider that the
                   phylogenetic relationships between the genomes have
                   been previously evaluated using a standard
                   phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology much
                   faster and scalable. This two-steps approach also
                   allows us to directly exploit existing phylogenetic
                   methods that detect bacterial recombination, and
                   therefore to account for the effect of recombination
                   in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We analysed
                   many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the
                   performance of our approach in a wide range of
                   situations. Furthermore, we present applications to
                   three different real datasets from recent bacterial
                   genomic studies. Our methodology is implemented in a
                   R package called BactDating which is freely available

                   replicating biological organisms can be used to infer
                   their evolu-tionary history. In case of measurably
                   evolving organisms genomes often reveal their
                   detailed spatio-temporal spread. Such phylodynamic
                   analyses are particularly useful to understand the
                   epidemiology of rapidly evolving viral pathogens. The
                   number of genome sequences available for different
                   pathogens, however, has increased dramatically over
                   the last couple of years and traditional methods for
                   phylodynamic analysis scale poorly with growing data
                   sets. Here, we present TreeTime, a python based
                   framework for phylodynamic analysis using an
                   approximate Maximum Likelihood approach. TreeTime can
                   estimate ancestral states, infer evolution models,
                   reroot trees to maximize temporal signals, estimate
                   molecular clock phylogenies and population size
                   histories. The run time of TreeTime scales linearly
                   with data set size. Phylogenetics uses differences
                   between homologous se-quences to infer the history of
                   the sample and learn about the evolutionary processes
                   that gave rise to the observed diversity. In absence
                   of recombination, this history is a tree along which
                   sequences descend from ancestors with modification.
                   In gen-eral, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
                   is a computation-ally difficult problem but efficient
                   heuristics often produce re-liable reconstructions in
                   polynomial time (Felsenstein, 2004; Price et al.,
                   2010; Stamatakis, 2014). Such heuristics become
                   indispensible for large data sets of hundreds or
                   thousands of sequences. In addition to tree building,
                   many research questions re-quire parameter inference
                   and hypothesis testing (Drummond et al., 2012; Pond
                   and Muse, 2005). Again, exact inference and testing
                   with large data sets is computationally expensive
                   since it requires high-dimensional optimization of
                   complex likelihood functions or extensive sampling of
                   the posterior. Efficient heuristics are needed to
                   cope with the growing data sets available today.},

  abstract =      {``Dated-tip'' methods of molecular dating use DNA
                   sequences sampled at different times, to estimate the
                   age of their most recent common ancestor. Several
                   tests of ``temporal signal'' are available to
                   determine whether datasets are suitable for such
                   analysis. However, it remains unclear whether these
                   tests are reliable. We investigate the performance of
                   several tests of temporal signal, including some
                   recently suggested modifications. We use simulated
                   data (where the true evolutionary history is known),
                   and whole-genomes of methicillin-resistant
                   Staphylococcus aureus (to show how particular
                   problems arise with real-world data sets). We show
                   that all of the standard tests of temporal signal are
                   seriously misleading for data where temporal and
                   genetic structure are confounded (i.e. where
                   closely-related sequences are more likely to have
                   been sampled at similar times). This is not an
                   artefact of genetic structure or tree shape per se,
                   and can arise even when sequences have measurably
                   evolved during the sampling period. More positively,
                   we show that a ``clustered permutation'' approach
                   introduced by Duch{\^e}ne et al. (2015a) can
                   successfully correct for this artefact in all cases,
                   and introduce techniques for implementing this method
                   with real data sets. The confounding of temporal and
                   genetic structure may be difficult to avoid in
                   practice, particularly for outbreaks of infectious
                   disease, or when using ancient DNA. Therefore, we
                   recommend the use of ``clustered permutation'' for
                   all analyses. The failure of the standard tests may
                   explain why different methods of dating pathogen
                   origins have reached such wildly different
                   conclusions. This article is protected by copyright.
